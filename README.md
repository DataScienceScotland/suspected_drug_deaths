# Suspected drug deaths in Scotland

This repository contains the reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) used to create the quarterly Suspected Drug Deaths publication. The data is sourced from management information collected by Police Scotland, and the latest iteration of the report can be found here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/suspected-drug-deaths-scotland-january-march-2022/

## Methodological note

Classifying a death as drug-related is complex. In Scotland there are two different sets of statistics on the number of drug deaths in Scotland. These suspected drug deaths are classified as such based on an officerâ€™s observations and initial enquiries at the scene of death. Note that these are *NOT* the Official Statistics published by the National Records of Scotland. Instead they are intended to provide an indicator of recent drug death trends in Scotland, to inform prevention and enforcement activities.
